# Creating a Model for Impressions of Elizabeth Warren's Snapchat ads in 2019

Senator Elizabeth Warren was one of the top spenders amongst Snapchat politcal advertisers.  Thus, I thought it would be relevant to create a model that could determine how many impressions an ad in 2019 would generate based on three different factors.  For these factors I chose the amount spent on the ad, the number of ads ran within the same month, and the number of days the ad ran.  By combining these factors into a multiple linear regression model, I was able to create a fairly accurate model for how many impressions an ad ran in 2019 would receive, and therefore how effective that ad was.

The result was the following model:
Number of impressions = 449.97 (Number of days ad ran) + 104.01 (Amount spent on advertisement) + 223.97 (Number ads in same month) - 31149.22

I was able to determine that my model was an accurate representation of reality by oberserving several values, including the R-squared, P-values, and F significance.
